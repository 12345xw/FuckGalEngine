# FuckGalEngine
This is a set of tools aims to translate Galgames (aka Visual Novels) into another language, including resource package, unpack/repack, program hooking to achieve some modifications and etc.

The code is not updated frequently, so maybe not up to date and thus won't work properly for some game engines.

If you have any questions (eg. usage, compile, working principleï¼Œ reverse engineering and etc.), please raise an Issue on this repository, DO NOT send emails to the contributors.
